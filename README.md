## Introduction:
  This project is nothing but trying to synchronize threads in Java, by simulating a scenario of the fair wheel ride in Java, a full description can found [here](https://github.com/AbdullahKady/thread-synchronization/blob/master/DOCS/description.pdf)


## Note:
  Adjust the relevant path of the input files depending on your project setup
In the current setup, I'm passing the relevant path assumnig the input files would be present at the folder `inputs` in the parent directory of the source files.
